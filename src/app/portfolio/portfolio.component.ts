      description: 'Aerologic is an educational software developed in Unity and C# by FF Studios as part of my Professional Practice I, aimed at teaching the principles of wind energy through interactive turbine simulations. This software seeks to raise awareness about renewable energy, especially wind energy, by providing users with an immersive educational experience that allows them to understand the energy generation process from wind capture to electricity production. The design of Aerologic incorporates several features that enhance the learning experience. These include the ability to customize environmental conditions, such as wind speed and terrain type, allowing users to observe how these factors impact energy generation. Gamification elements, such as challenges and rewards, have also been added to encourage active engagement and commitment to learning. These features not only improve information retention but also transform learning into an interactive and engaging experience. For the development of Aerologic, agile methodologies were employed, enabling a dynamic process of improvement and adjustment to ensure that the software met the educational objectives. The implementation of advanced programming practices and graphic design optimized both the functionality and usability of the simulator, offering an intuitive and appealing interface that facilitates user interaction. Overall, Aerologic fulfills the purpose of creating a high-impact educational tool that promotes knowledge and understanding of wind energy, contributing to greater awareness of the importance of renewable energy in protecting the environment.',
